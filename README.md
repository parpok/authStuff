#  I'm just playing around auth in Supabase

Its kind of cool because It can be done very quickly. But its exlpained kind of poorly so it might be confusing

If you want to run this thing just make a swift File where you define the client for Supabase like 

```swift
import Supabase
import Foundation 
let supabase = SupabaseClient(supabaseURL: URL(string: " INSERT URL SUPABASE GIVES ")!, supabaseKey: " INSERT SUPABASE KEY")
```

bruh
